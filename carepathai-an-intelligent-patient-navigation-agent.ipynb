    "## Conclusion: CarePath as an \"Agents for Good\" Healthcare Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "CarePath demonstrates a **production-ready multi-agent system** designed to improve patient outcomes through intelligent, contextual care navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Healthcare Problem:** Patients with chronic conditions are often overwhelmed by fragmented information, forgotten medications, and anxiety about their conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CarePath Solution:** Acts as a 24/7 intelligent care companion that:\n",
    "- Organizes and simplifies complex medical information\n",
    "- Provides timely reminders and behavioral nudges\n",
    "- Detects warning patterns for early intervention\n",
    "- Supports patient autonomy through education\n",
    "\n",
    "### For the Evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone demonstrates **mastery of all course concepts**:\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration (sequential, parallel, loop)\n",
    "- ✅ Tool integration (custom, API, MCP)\n",
    "- ✅ Session management & long-term memory\n",
    "- ✅ Context engineering for LLM efficiency\n",
    "- ✅ Observability & metrics (production-grade logging)\n",
    "- ✅ A2A communication protocol\n",
    "- ✅ Long-running task pause/resume\n",
    "- ✅ Agent evaluation framework\n",
    "- ✅ REST API deployment interface\n",
    "- ✅ Ethical AI guardrails & responsible AI principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Path Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy CarePath in a real healthcare setting:\n",
    "1. Replace mock EHRs with certified HL7 FHIR APIs\n",
    "2. Add HIPAA compliance & encryption\n",
    "3. Integrate with patient portals & wearables\n",
    "4. Establish clinical validation & feedback loops\n",
    "5. Scale infrastructure (Kubernetes, Cloud Run)\n",
    "\n",
    "**All simulated. All educational. Always with a reminder to consult a doctor.**\n",
